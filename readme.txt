This is a fun little project I spent a bit on, because I read about Cantor Expansions in my Discrete Mathematics textbook and I think they are really cool.

Cantor expansions depict integers as sums of the products of 

A basic explaination of how it works can be found here:

A more details discussion of Cantor Expansions can be found here:

This only works for positive integers so far, and I hope at some point to add in addition of cantor expansions and a couple other functions.
